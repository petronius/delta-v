In the first century or so of human spaceflight, the leading scientific
and engineering minds of the day grappled with what they called "the
tyranny of the rocket equation", which described the exponential increase
in weight required to lift ever-heavier craft into orbit.

By the middle of the 22nd century, however, the creation of stable fusion
reactors dramatically changed the mathematics of fuel-mass to energy
output, and a second space age was born.

The moon, the inner solar system, and finally the rocks and satellites of
the outer solar system were colonized and industrialized. A universe that had
been shruk by jet-travel and networked computer systems expanded again,
suddenly and dramatically.

Out in the depths of space, some found their fortune. Others, a new home.
Political systems grew and adapted, societies fragmented and sythensized,
and within a few generations everything had changed.

But human life remains bounded by two irreversable physical laws: the
first is the speed of light, which may be approached, but never
surpassed. The second is the pull of gravity, from which there is no
escape.

Forced by nature to cut long, graceful curves over the surface of the
cosmos, all space-ship captains know that one number is binding, one
number answers the question "can I reach my destination?" This second
tyranny, the relationship between movement and change in velocity, is known as 
"delta-v" (Î”v).


GAMEPLAY THINGS TO REMEMBER
===========================

- EGA Trek (explore and shoot suff)
- Resupply
- Faction alignment (think Deus Ex, not WoW rep)
- You are playing as your crew (the ship), not your captain (the person), like in *FTL*

## Things I am bored by

- RNGsus
- NPC shops
- Powerful high-tech kit that can't take care of itself


STORY MODE NOTES
================

- Blap stuff.
- Resist urge to go all Kim Stanley Robinson, no one cares.
- Need a good MacGuffin (jump drive?)
- A dose of Oregon Trail, perhaps?

## Missions

1. Get from New Berlin to Mars, find out why they shot the sheriff.
    - Find out they didn't, go after who did (outer solar system story)
        - Eventually leads to (2)
    - Find out they did, start a war (blap blap)
        - Go chasing something as part of campaign, leads to (2)
2. Go chasing an Ansible.
    - Turns out its an FTL
    - Use it to blap some shit
