- Distance is always known.

"Your flight computer can calculate this using a combination of stellar parallax,
known current motion of your own ship, and other data points." (always comes
from game state)

- Orbits are known if transmitted, and guessed the rest of the time.

Known orbits should display maneuver vectors being executed, rather than
just have the orbit shift with no prompt. (pulled from game state)

Interpolated orbits are determined from the last two observed points in some
interval. (p1, p2, v1, v2 pulled from game state)

- Even if sth is transmitting data to you, if you aren't either in LOS of (at
least one of) their transmitters, or they aren't transmitting via the planetary
traffic control (if there is one), you get no data.

+ Earth/Moon - Always, as long as Space-UNATCO likes you
+ Mars - Ditto for Space-NSF
+ "wilder" planetary systems, depends. science stations may have local traffic
  control.
